For generating the data for tables in the report (LATEX), follow these steps:

1. Execute the script "table_data_gen.sh"
    - Check the arguments to be passed namely, the list of n (the number of points), and the number of samples to be generated
    for each value of n
    - There are two possible options to run the script, and we need to uncomment the lines appropriately
    - One option is to generate data for the Tables 1,2
    - Other is to generate data for the Table 3

2. Run the file table_data.py and the appropriate statistics will be printed on the terminal corresponding to all the three tables
    - Ensure that there are two files in the data_report_tables directory: data_table_1.csv, data_table_3.csv 
      before running this python script
